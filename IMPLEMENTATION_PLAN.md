# KubeGenie: Kubernetes Agent & Multi-Cluster Implementation Plan

## 1. Agent Abstraction
- Create a base `KubernetesAgent` class to encapsulate cluster operations, lifecycle, and health management.
- Refactor existing client logic into agent classes.
- Implement lifecycle hooks: `initialize`, `health_check`, `shutdown`, `self_heal`.

## 2. Multi-Cluster Management
- Design a `ClusterManager` class/module to register, list, and switch between clusters (contexts, credentials).
- Support dynamic registration for cloud and bare metal clusters.
- Add API endpoints for cluster management (add, remove, list, switch).

## 3. Cloud Cluster Provisioning
- Implement modules for provisioning clusters in EKS, GKE, AKS using respective cloud SDKs.
- Integrate with Crossplane for cluster creation (not just resource provisioning).
- Add endpoints for cluster provisioning and status tracking.

## 4. Bare Metal Support
- Document and implement connection flows for bare metal clusters (API server, credentials).
- Add support for custom endpoints and authentication.
- Provide examples and configuration templates.

## 5. Extensibility
- Refactor to use a provider/agent registry for easy addition of new cluster types.
- Consider plugin architecture for new cloud/bare metal providers.
- Document extension points and contribution guidelines.

## 6. Agent Lifecycle Management
- Add health checks, self-healing routines, and lifecycle management to agents.
- Implement periodic health monitoring and auto-recovery.
- Expose agent status via API endpoints.

## 7. Custom Resource & Operator Support
- Expose endpoints for managing custom resources (CRDs) and operators.
- Add logic for custom controllers and reconciliation loops.
- Provide templates for common CRDs and operator patterns.

## 8. Documentation & Examples
- Update documentation to cover new abstractions, flows, and extension points.
- Provide example configurations for cloud and bare metal clusters.
- Add usage guides for multi-cluster and agent features.

## 9. Testing & Validation
- Write unit and integration tests for new agent, manager, and provisioning logic.
- Validate multi-cluster operations in CI/CD pipeline.
- Add test cases for cloud and bare metal scenarios.
