# KubeGenie - AI Kubernetes Assistant
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Based on technical review of conversational Kubernetes management platform with multi-agent architecture.

## Core Functional Architecture

### Conversational Agent Driven
- **Multi-agent design pattern** with modular agents for distinct domains:
  - Monitoring & Anomaly Detection Agent
  - Cost Optimization Agent  
  - Security Agent
- **Microservices/logical modules** operating on dedicated domains (system telemetry, financial metrics, RBAC/security signals)
- **Extensible and decoupled scaling** for future agent additions

### Real-Time Cluster Integration
- **Direct Kubernetes cluster connection** (Kind for dev/test environments)
- **Command execution and parsing** (`kubectl get pods`, list nodes, show namespaces)
- **Orchestrator status reporting** with real-time cluster state
- **Backend Python service** interfacing with kubeconfig context
- **API exposure** through web backend

### Gradio-Based Frontend
- **Rapid prototyping and deployment** with Gradio framework

- **Orchestrator-to-agent communication** for scalable operations
- **Future expansion support** for custom agents (networking, upgrades, etc.)

### System Health Monitoring
- **Real-time node status feedback** (role, version, health, restarts)
- **Polling routines or webhook observers** for fast status aggregation
- **Immediate cluster health assessment**

### Command Processing
- **Chat-to-structured request conversion** with intent classification
- **Direct kubectl invocations** and high-level infrastructure analysis
- **Natural language understanding layer** for command parsing

### Resource Management
- **Namespace and resource awareness** with contextual breakdown

## Technical Limitations & Gaps

### Cluster Management
- **Single cluster context limitation** - only supports one Kind cluster
- **No multi-kubeconfig support** for production-grade clusters
- **Missing cloud provider integration** (AWS, GCP, Azure)

### Observability Integration
- **Limited deep observability** - no log streaming or distributed tracing
- **Missing monitoring stack integration** (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/Datadog)
- **No real-time debugging capabilities** for platform engineering
- **Lack of alerting mechanisms**

### Agent Intelligence
- **Passive agent listing** without actionable outputs
- **Missing diagnostic recommendations** and health alerts
- **No resource analysis** or cost breakdowns
- **Limited anomaly detection outputs**

### Security & Access Control
- **No visible security controls** in UI/UX
- **Missing authentication mechanisms** (OAuth/JWT)
- **No role-based access controls**
- **Absent audit logging** and compliance tooling

### API & Integration
- **Limited API exposure** without endpoint schemas
- **Missing authentication flow documentation**
- **No code samples** for integration
- **Lack of CI/CD automation framework support**

### Error Handling & Reliability
- **Minimal failure scenario feedback** (cluster connect failures, unhealthy pods)
- **Missing permission denied handling**
- **No remediation messaging** for operational issues
- **Limited error capture mechanisms**

### Scalability Constraints
- **No multi-cluster federation** support
- **Missing advanced Kubernetes features** (autoscaling, upgrades, draining)
- **No custom resource handling**
- **Limited to hundreds/thousands of clusters**

## Strategic Enhancement: Crossplane Integration

### Cloud-Native Infrastructure Orchestration
Integrating **Crossplane** would transform KubeGenie from a Kubernetes-focused assistant into a comprehensive **cloud-native platform orchestrator**, enabling true multi-cloud Infrastructure-as-Code through conversational interfaces.

#### Key Capabilities Unlocked

**1. Declarative Multi-Cloud Resource Provisioning**
- **Natural language to infrastructure**: "Create a Postgres database in AWS" â†’ Crossplane Custom Resources
- **Unified cloud management**: Provision databases, networks, storage, and services across AWS, GCP, Azure
- **Kubernetes-native APIs**: Manage cloud infrastructure using familiar kubectl patterns
- **GitOps-enabled**: Version-controlled infrastructure changes through declarative manifests

**2. Platform Engineering Self-Service**
- **Composition blueprints**: Platform engineers define reusable infrastructure templates
- **Developer self-service**: "Give me a dev environment with database and cache" via chat interface
- **Shift-left infrastructure**: Reduce ticket-based provisioning dependency
- **Governance at scale**: Policy-driven resource creation with automatic compliance

**3. Full-Stack Lifecycle Management**
- **End-to-end orchestration**: Provision, update, monitor, and teardown cloud resources
- **Cross-cluster resource tracking**: Unified view of applications and infrastructure
- **Automated remediation**: Self-healing for both workloads and managed services
- **Cost lifecycle management**: Track resource costs from creation to deletion

**4. Enhanced Agent Intelligence**
- **Infrastructure-aware agents**: Optimize across pods, databases, queues, and cloud services
- **Cross-cloud recommendations**: "Detect orphaned resources across AWS and GCP accounts"
- **Cost optimization**: "Recommend rightsizing for RDS instances and compute clusters"
- **Security compliance**: "Audit cloud resource configurations against security policies"

#### Conversational Use Cases with Crossplane
