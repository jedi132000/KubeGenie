# AI-Powered Kubernetes Multi-Cluster Management Platform – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview & Vision
This platform leverages advanced AI agents and orchestration to manage 10,000+ Kubernetes clusters efficiently at scale. It automates operational, remediation, optimization, and compliance tasks with minimal human intervention and high reliability. The user interface is a responsive Gradio-based dashboard tailored for operator and SRE workflows.

## 2. Objectives
- Automate monitoring, remediation, cost optimization, upgrades, and compliance across all clusters.
- Use multi-agent AI orchestration for real-time, explainable actions.
- Provide intuitive unified front-end for search, actions, and analytics.
- Streamline root-cause analysis, scenario simulation, and operational approvals.
- Integrate a robust RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline powered by a vector database for fast, relevant operational knowledge retrieval.

## 3. Key Features & Capabilities
### Agentic Automation
- Specialized agents for:
  - Monitoring/Anomaly Detection
  - Automated Remediation
  - Cost Optimization
  - Security/Compliance
  - Upgrade/Rollback
- Central AI Orchestrator manages agent tasks, coordination, dependencies, and escalation.

### AI/ML Enhancements
- Predictive incident forecasting using ML/AI models.
- Root cause and log pattern analysis via LLMs and vector search.
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with private runbooks, configs, incident history—all indexed and retrieved through the vector database.
- Natural language operator queries, scenario simulation ("What if...?").

### Vector Database Backed Knowledge Base
- Ingest and embed content from SRE runbooks, incident postmortems, troubleshooting guides, cluster configs, and chat/SOC transcripts into a vector DB (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, Milvus).
- Enable all agents and the Gradio UI to instantly retrieve semantically relevant documents and operational playbooks before taking action.
- Power Gradio search modules for knowledge exploration, context lookup, and AI-generated recommendations with full traceability to knowledge sources.

### Gradio Front-End
- Chat-driven command and query for troubleshooting, analytics, and workflows.
- Real-time dashboards (cluster health, cost, risks, action history).
- Approval and notification flows for sensitive operations.
- Operator preferences, dark mode, role-based access.
- Semantic search interface for knowledge base queries, "why" tracebacks, and surfacing precedent from historical incidents.

### Data & Action Layer
- Multi-source data ingestion: metrics, events, logs, configs.
- Secure API access for Kubernetes control plane actions.
- Full audit and event logs, agent explainability, and override controls.

## 4. User Stories
- As an SRE, I want to see AI-curated cluster health anomalies in one dashboard, so I can prioritize my attention.
- As an SRE, I want agents to automatically remediate disk pressure with traceable justifications, so I can trust automation at scale.
- As an SRE, I want to run "what if" simulations for upgrades with an AI-powered risk forecast.
- As an SRE, I want the agent to show the knowledge base source (playbook/doc) behind every recommendation or automated remediation.
- As an engineer, I want to semantically search all engineering runbooks, configs, and past incidents from the Gradio UI.
- As a cost optimizer, I want agents to recommend node pool right-sizing based on historical usage and cite relevant guidelines from the knowledge base.

## 5. Workflow Example
1. Operator requests "Show all clusters with urgent CPU anomalies and auto-remediate if possible."
2. Monitoring Agent detects clusters via ML anomaly detection.
3. Orchestrator sends to Remediation Agent for recommended action, retrieving playbooks/scripts from vector DB; asks operator for approval if action is high-impact.
4. Actions, justifications (with knowledge source links), and explanations appear in Gradio UI; operator can override, approve, or simulate.

## 6. Metrics & KPIs
- Reduction in mean time to detect/remediate (MTTD/MTTR)
- % of incidents auto-detected and resolved
- Operator satisfaction (NPS), dashboard/search usage
- Audit logs: agent accuracy, incident false positive/negative rates
- Coverage of knowledge sources in the vector DB (knowledge base "recall")

## 7. Technical Stack
- Python (LangChain/LangGraph, Kubernetes Python Client)
- LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic), vector DB (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, Milvus)
- TimescaleDB/PostgreSQL for metrics, logs, history
- Gradio for UI; FastAPI for backend APIs
- Event Bus (RabbitMQ/NATS) for agent communication

## 8. Security & Compliance
- RBAC controls for all agent actions.
- Manual approval thresholds for sensitive ops.
- Complete auditability and explainable AI decisions, with knowledge-source links for every automated action.
- TLS encryption, secrets management, and compliance-ready audit artifacts.

## 9. Out of Scope (MVP)
- Full multi-cloud abstraction (initial focus on K8s API compatibility)
- Custom cluster provisioning features
- Agent support for non-K8s workloads (extendable in future)
